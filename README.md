old-xoops-premium-themes
========================

These are old XOOPS Premium themes and are released open source now.

I released a series of themes during 2010. Some of them were "premium", i.e. you had to pay for them back then  
It's been such a long time and I haven't seen active usages of these themes. 

So I've open-sourced them. You can do whatever you like: tweaking, further customizing, etc. 
I am not sure whether they work with current XOOPS or not. 
If it does not work, feel free to fix them (on Github, fork it, make the fix and send pull request)
